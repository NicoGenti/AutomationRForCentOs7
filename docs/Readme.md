## Notes

- *IsRunning.ps1 file:*
	
	- Is the only one that is called by the CronTab;
	- If one of the following checks is successful, the program will be blocked:
		1.If a files download is in progress (by checking the Download.start file);
		2.If a production is in progress (by checking the Production.start file);
		3.If a previous production has failed (by checking the Production.fail file)
	- It has its own log file into /Logs folder;
	- It does not send mails. Because it would get a lot of failure mails if the program is running
	- Inside the .start, .end and .fail files, the program will write which files it is processing
- *Main program Logs:*

  - Log file is located in the / Logs folder and is named: log(production data).txt
  - Program will send an email of the logs, which will be written in the body of the same,filtered in this way:
    - non-blocking errors for production, such as the latest historical files,
    - production blocking errors, such as R script breaking;
    - production was successful;
